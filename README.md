# AttendEase
Project description: A facial recognition software integrated with real-time database with Python, OpenCV,
CVZone for webcam-based attendance verification. The tool uses machine learning algorithms to identify the student's faces via their webcam to mark their attendance. The data is then stored in our firebase and google cloud platform database.

## Pre-requisites:
-Pipenv (latest version)

## How to use:
In the initial run, run EncodeGenerator.py and AddDatatoDatabse.py to generate image encoding and store the initial data in database
After that, run main.py to use the attendance system.

## Technologies used:
- Python
- OpenCV
- CVZone
## How the app looks :D
